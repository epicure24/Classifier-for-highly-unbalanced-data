To classify this type of data, we need to first balance the data. 

# How to balance the unbalanced data ?

Apply different resampling techniques to balance the data : there are 2 kinds of resampling techniques - OVERSAMPLING & UNDERSAMPLING techniques.

**Tomek Links**

**Condensed Nearest Neighbor**

**Edited Nearest Neighbor**

## Combination of Oversampling & Undersampling Techniques

**One Sided Selection (Tomek Links and the Condensed Nearest Neighbor (CNN)**

**Neighborhood Cleaning Rule (Condensed Nearest Neighbor & Edited Nearest Neighbors )**
